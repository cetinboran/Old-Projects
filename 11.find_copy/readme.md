# Find The Copy Images And Delete Them
This script finds the all copy images in the specific folder and deletes them.

## How does that work?
For this script to work, the script must be outside of the images folder. When you run the script you have to enter the
file name and you have to write the way 'copy' is spelled like 'Copy, copy, coPy etc.'

If any turkish characters in your folder's name this script doesnt work.

### Requirements
+ subprocess
+ os
